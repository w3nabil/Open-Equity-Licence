The Open Equity (OE) Licence promotes open and ethical knowledge sharing while preventing commercial misuse, political manipulation, harmful applications, and unethical AI training. It also provides an optional regional restriction mechanism, allowing authors to prohibit use of their work in specific territories when necessary.

The OE Licence is built on a simple principle:
“Free for Free Work, Pay for Paid Work.”
It ensures that non-commercial, educational, and humanitarian users retain full freedom, while commercial entities using the work fairly compensate the author.

Persons or entities within these restricted territories **may not share, redistribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, or use the content for any purpose**, including commercial, non-commercial, charitable, academic, or political use. These restrictions apply to **users**, not to governments or platforms. However, platforms hosting the work are *encouraged* to restrict access where technically feasible. Platforms can crawl the ./tr.json to fetch the raw data (in ISO-3166-2 format) to automate the process without any hassle. 

# Usages 

You must give appropriate credit and provide a link to our work. You may not use, adapt, modify, or distribute the work in a manner that intentionally promotes **hate speech**, **incitement to violence**, or **explicit discrimination** against any religion, ethnicity, or protected group. This clause applies only to **uses involving this work** and does not regulate the user’s unrelated personal expression.

## Commercial 

Commercial use of the work, including use in products, paid services, revenue-generating access, subscription-based enterprise integration, monetised platforms, or any activity that generates direct or indirect revenue, is **prohibited without prior written permission from us**. 

## Non-Commercial 

Non-commercial uses are allowed under certain regulations: (i) the use must not generate any direct or indirect financial benefit. (ii) Redistribution or remixing is allowed, **but we request that you send** a copy of the adapted or printed version to us for record-keeping. (2.1) If your redistributed content contains other content than our work, you are not required to share the other works which we do not own. (2.2) A *copy* may be sent as a PDF, DOCX, RMD, MD, TEX or equivalent document showing the adaptation. (2.3) When submitting a document, you do not need permission in reply from us to publish your work publicly; you may do so anytime you wish to publish your work. (2.4) If your work is unpublished and you are sending the copy, please mention the publication metadata, such as where it would be published, who the co-authors are, what language is being used in your work, your ORCID profile, etc., if possible. (2.5) If your work is already published, you can just share the DOI and/or any permanent link with us. 

## Political 

The work may not be used in any manner that directly supports (i) **political campaigning**, (ii) **election advertising**, or (iii) **material officially produced by, or for the benefit of, a political party or candidate.** This restriction applies only to uses where the work is incorporated into political messaging. 

It is important to mention that we do not restrict (i) academic research, (ii) journalism, (iii) policy analysis, or (iv) private individual opinion. Other than the restrictions, the above commercial and non-commercial rules apply.

## Charity and/or Relief 

Use, reproduction, distribution, and modification of the work for charitable or humanitarian purposes are permitted under the following conditions: (i) The organisation must be a **non-profit or charitable organisation** that is legally recognised in its jurisdiction.

(iii) Upon request, the organisation must provide the author with a **good-faith summary** of how the work was used and how proceeds were allocated. (iv) Misrepresentation of charitable use or fraudulent allocation of funds may result in revocation of rights and legal action.

# Machine Learning and/or AI 

Any AI can crawl robots.txt to automate the process without a manual process, as the instructions for robots are clarified there. 

## Prohibition 

Our work must not be used for training, fine-tuning, or evaluating **any commercial machine learning model**, including models that charge for access, provide paid plans, or are embedded in commercial products or services. Using our work to create derivative datasets intended for commercial AI development is strictly prohibited.

## Permission

Upon proper attribution, you are given the following permissions: (i) Open-source and/or free-of-charge AI models are allowed to use our datasets to train and fine-tune for non-commercial and academic purposes. (ii) The models may not be commercialised in the future.

## Search and/or Scholarly Indexing 

Automated indexing by search engines for the purpose of discoverability is permitted, provided it does not store full copies of the work for AI training. Any commercial or non-commercial entity is allowed to store the title, DOI, our name, publishing date, and metadata for record-keeping purposes. 

## Archive Regulations 

Any academic and/or non-commercial archive library is allowed to store the original work and distribute it under the same licence as the original purposes and/or track version information for future analysis. 

## No Transfer of Training Rights 

You should not sublicense or transfer the right to use the work for machine learning purposes to any third party. When you are permitted to train or fine-tune, it does not grant an ownership transformation of our work. 

## Violation Consequences  

Any use of the work in commercial machine learning systems or commercial and/or non-commercial and/or academic use in restricted territories constitutes a breach of this licence and may result in legal action, including revocation of rights and claims for damages.

# Third-Party Attribution 

 Some content may not be owned by us where this licence does not apply; for those, the formal credit, including the respective licence and author/s, is mentioned, which can be found at the end of the content in the reference section (for paper) and/or in the dedicated credit section (for software). 

# Sensitive Data and Security

You may not publicly disclose or redistribute any material from the work that contains exploit code, proof-of-concept attacks, vulnerability payloads, system logs, or other information that could reasonably be used to compromise security systems. You are requested to share any data marked or designated as **“restricted”, “sensitive”, “internal”, or “security-critical”** in a secure encrypted p-2-p method with other researchers or the person in charge. Users incorporating security-sensitive elements from this work into derivative works must ensure that the derivative does not expose vulnerabilities to the public, appropriate safety and disclosure practices are followed, and no laws concerning cybersecurity, data protection, or export control are violated.  
Misuse of security-sensitive information, especially in a way that endangers any person, organisation, system, or network, may result in revocation of rights under this licence and legal action.

This work is provided **“as is”,** without any express or implied warranties, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not guarantee the accuracy, safety, completeness, or performance of the work. Even if we have mentioned such data, they only represent the lab performance. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or claims arising from using or inability to use the work, security incidents resulting from improper implementation, any derivative or modified versions created by others, and component damage. You are requested to interact with, apply, or deploy the work **at your own risk**.
